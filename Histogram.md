# HISTOGRAM:

![](https://github.com/ramsha275/ML/blob/main/hist.png)

a) In scatter plot we can't identify how many data points have been plotted for each type like we can't count how many number of **Setosa**, **Virginica** and **Versicolor** species are plotted.

b) In histogram number of counts are plotted on Y-Axis.

c) You can take only 1 feature to plot histogram. If you take 3 features, 3 different graphs will be plotted.
